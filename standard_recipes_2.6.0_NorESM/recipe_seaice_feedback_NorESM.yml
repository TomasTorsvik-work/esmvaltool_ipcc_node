  title: |
    Ice Formation Efficiency (IFE).

  description: |
    This recipe is related to the negative sea-ice growth–thickness feedback
    In this recipe, one process-based diagnostic named the
    Ice Formation Efficiency (IFE) is computed based on monthly mean
    sea-ice volume estimated north of 80°N. The choice of this domain
    is motivated by the desire to minimize the influence of dynamic
    processes but also by the availability of sea-ice thickness measurements.
    The diagnostic intends to evaluate the strength of the negative sea-ice
    thickness/growth feedback, which causes late-summer negative anomalies
    in sea-ice area and volume to be partially recovered during the next
    growing season. A chief cause behind the existence of this feedback is
    the non-linear inverse dependence between heat conduction fluxes and
    sea-ice thickness, which implies that thin sea ice grows faster than thick
    sea ice. To estimate the strength of that feedback, anomalies of the annual
    minimum of sea-ice volume north of 80°N are first estimated. Then,
    the increase in sea-ice volume until the next annual maximum is computed
    for each year. The IFE is defined as the regression of this ice volume
    production onto the baseline summer volume anomaly.
